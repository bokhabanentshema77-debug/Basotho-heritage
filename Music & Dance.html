<h1>The brief discription of Basotho music and dances</h1>

<p>The Basotho people normally do their traditional dances and music on their special occations.The dances are normally done when there are special occurtions like when people are getting married there will be some rejoycement after that as a dance.But with music it is way too different because Basotho men can just sing the mokorotlo song when they are chilling at <i>Khotla ea banna</i> for no reason.Some of their songs are just for encourage them to have peace.</p>
